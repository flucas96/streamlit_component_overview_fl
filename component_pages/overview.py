        <b>Using Streamlit daily in a professional context for the last three years</b>, I have encountered several instances where I needed a bit more functionality. <br><br>
        
        Often, Streamlit offered too little customizability to perfectly meet the client's needs. Because of this, I explored creating my own Streamlit components to extend its functionality. <br><br>
        
        The first component I developed was the <b>Star Rating</b> component. Its main purpose was to help me learn how to use React and TypeScript to create a component and publish it on PyPI. <br><br>
        
        Since then, I have created several more components, each designed to address one or more specific shortcomings I encountered in Streamlit at the time. Feel free to explore them using the menu on the rightâ€”<i>(which, by the way, is also a custom component ðŸ˜‰)</i>.
